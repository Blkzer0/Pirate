# Pirate
I wrote this small script that uses pyrit to crack wpa/2 capture files. The script consists two popular ways of cracking wpa/2 files. Method 1 uses the usual dictionary attack and method 2 cracks the cap file against passwords stored in the pyrit databse. 
Please use pyrit --help for any more info pertaining to the original script. I just wrote this script to be used as either a learning tool or if you are lazy to write out the commands and just need to quickly evaluate more than one capture file.
I encourage you to learn how to do this manually. Send me feed back if something is not working.

Script needs 4 functions to run:
1. Capture file wither its pcap or cap format.
2. SSID ( Name of the target AP)
3. BSSID ( Mac address of the AP)
4. Path to wordlist

+Disclaimer: I am not responsible for the damage or misuse of this script.
